  "body": "![Realm](logo.png)\r\n\r\nRealm is a mobile database that runs directly inside phones, tablets or wearables.\r\nThis repository holds the source code for the Java version of Realm, which currently runs only on Android.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n* **Mobile-first:** Realm is the first database built from the ground up to run directly inside phones, tablets and wearables.\r\n* **Simple:** Data is directly exposed as objects and queryable by code, removing the need for ORM's riddled with performance & maintenance issues. Plus, we've worked hard to [keep our API down to very few classes](https://realm.io/docs/java/): most of our users pick it up intuitively, getting simple apps up & running in minutes.\r\n* **Modern:** Realm supports easy thread-safety, relationships & encryption.\r\n* **Fast:** Realm is faster than even raw SQLite on common operations, while maintaining an extremely rich feature set.\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\nPlease see the [detailed instructions in our docs](https://realm.io/docs/java/#installation) to add Realm to your project.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nDocumentation for Realm can be found at [realm.io/docs/java](https://realm.io/docs/java).\r\nThe API reference is located at [realm.io/docs/java/api](https://realm.io/docs/java/api).\r\n\r\n## Getting Help\r\n\r\n- **Need help with your code?**: Look for previous questions on the [#realm tag](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/realm?sort=newest) — or [ask a new question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=realm). We activtely monitor & answer questions on SO!\r\n- **Have a bug to report?** [Open an issue](https://github.com/realm/realm-java/issues/new). If possible, include the version of Realm, a full log, the Realm file, and a project that shows the issue.\r\n- **Have a feature request?** [Open an issue](https://github.com/realm/realm-java/issues/new). Tell us what the feature should do, and why you want the feature.\r\n- Sign up for our [**Community Newsletter**](http://eepurl.com/VEKCn) to get regular tips, learn about other use-cases and get alerted of blogposts and tutorials about Realm.\r\n\r\n## Using Snapshots\r\n\r\nIf you want to test recent bugfixes or features that have not been packaged in an official release yet, you can use a **-SNAPSHOT** release of the current development version of Realm via Gradle, available on [OJO](http://oss.jfrog.org/oss-snapshot-local/io/realm/realm-android/)\r\n\r\n```gradle\r\nbuildscript {\r\n    repositories {\r\n        maven {\r\n            url 'http://oss.jfrog.org/artifactory/oss-snapshot-local'\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    dependencies {\r\n        classpath \"io.realm:realm-gradle-plugin:<version>-SNAPSHOT\"\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nrepositories {\r\n    maven {\r\n        url 'http://oss.jfrog.org/artifactory/oss-snapshot-local'\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee [version.txt](version.txt) for the latest version number.\r\n\r\n## Building Realm\r\n\r\nIn case you don't want to use the precompiled version, you can build Realm yourself from source.\r\n\r\n### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n * Download the [**JDK 7**](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html) or [**JDK 8**](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) from Oracle and install it.\r\n * Download & install the Android SDK **Build-Tools 24.0.0**, **Android N (API 24)** (for example through Android Studio’s **Android SDK Manager**).\r\n * Download the **Android NDK (= r10e)** for [OS X](http://dl.google.com/android/ndk/android-ndk-r10e-darwin-x86_64.bin) or [Linux](http://dl.google.com/android/ndk/android-ndk-r10e-linux-x86_64.bin).\r\n * Install CMake from SDK manager in Android Studio (\"SDK Tools\" -> \"CMake\").\r\n * Or you can use [Hombrew-versions](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-versions) to install Android NDK for Mac:\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    brew tap homebrew/versions\r\n    brew install android-ndk-r10e\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n * Add two environment variables to your profile:\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    export ANDROID_HOME=~/Library/Android/sdk\r\n    export ANDROID_NDK_HOME=/usr/local/Cellar/android-ndk-r10e/r10e\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n * If you want to build with Android Studio, `ndk.dir` has to be defined in the `realm/local.properties` as well.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    ndk.dir=/usr/local/Cellar/android-ndk-r10e/r10e\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n * If you are using OS X, you'd be better to add following lines to `~/.profile` (or `~/.zprofile` if the login shell is `zsh`) in order for Android Studio to see those environment variables.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    launchctl setenv ANDROID_HOME \"$ANDROID_HOME\"\r\n    launchctl setenv ANDROID_NDK_HOME \"$ANDROID_NDK_HOME\"\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n * And if you'd like to specify the location to store the archives of Realm's core, set `REALM_CORE_DOWNLOAD_DIR` environment variable. It enables you to keep core's archive when executing `git clean -xfd`.\r\n\r\n   ```\r\n   export REALM_CORE_DOWNLOAD_DIR=~/.realmCore\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n   OS X users should also add following line to `~/.profile` (or `~/.zprofile` if the login shell is `zsh`) in order for Android Studio to see this environment variable..\r\n\r\n   ```\r\n   launchctl setenv REALM_CORE_DOWNLOAD_DIR \"$REALM_CORE_DOWNLOAD_DIR\"\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n### Download sources\r\n\r\nYou can download the source code of Realm Java by using git. Since realm-java has git submodules, use `--recursive` when cloning the repository.\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone git@github.com:realm/realm-java.git --recursive\r\n```\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/realm/realm-java.git --recursive\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Build\r\n\r\nOnce you have completed all the pre-requisites building Realm is done with a simple command\r\n\r\n```\r\n./gradlew assemble\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat command will generate:\r\n\r\n * a jar file for the Realm Gradle plugin\r\n * an aar file for the Realm library\r\n * a jar file for the annotations\r\n * a jar file for the annotations processor\r\n\r\n### Other Commands\r\n\r\n * `./gradlew tasks` will show all the available tasks\r\n * `./gradlew javadoc` will generate the Javadocs\r\n * `./gradlew monkeyExamples` will run the monkey tests on all the examples\r\n * `./gradlew installRealmJava` will install the Realm library and plugin to mavenLocal()\r\n * `./gradlew clean -PdontCleanJniFiles` will remove all generated files except for JNI related files. This saves recompilation time a lot.\r\n * `./gradlew connectedUnitTests -PbuildTargetABIs=$(adb shell getprop ro.product.cpu.abi)` will build JNI files only for the ABI which corresponds to the connected device.\r\n\r\nGenerating the Javadoc using the command above will report a large number of warnings. The Javadoc is generated, and we will fix the issue in the near future.\r\n\r\n### Gotchas\r\n\r\nThe repository is organized in six Gradle projects:\r\n\r\n * `realm`: it contains the actual library (including the JNI layer) and the annotations processor.\r\n * `realm-annotations`: it contains the annotations defined by Realm.\r\n * `realm-transformer`: it contains the bytecode transformer.\r\n * `gradle-plugin`: it contains the Gradle plugin.\r\n * `examples`: it contains the example projects. This project directly depends on `gradle-plugin` which adds a dependency to the artifacts produced by `realm`.\r\n * The root folder is another Gradle project and all it does is orchestrating the other jobs\r\n\r\nThis means that `./gradlew clean` and `./gradlew cleanExamples` will fail if `assembleExamples` has not been executed first.\r\nNote that IntelliJ [does not support multiple projects in the same window](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEABKL-6118#)\r\nso each sub-project must be opened in its own window.\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\nThe `./examples` folder contain a number of example projects showing how Realm can be used. If this is the first time you checkout or pull a new version of this repository to try the examples, you must call `./gradlew installRealmJava` from the top-level directory first. Otherwise the examples will not compile as they depend on all Realm artifacts being installed in `mavenLocal()`.\r\n\r\nStandalone examples can be [downloaded from website](https://realm.io/docs/java/latest/#getting-started).\r\n\r\n## Running Tests Using The Realm Object Server\r\n\r\nTests in `realm/realm-library/src/syncIntegrationTest` require a running testing server to work.\r\nA docker image can be built from `tools/sync_test_server/Dockerfile` to run the test server.\r\n`tools/sync_test_server/start_server.sh` will build the docker image automatically.\r\n\r\nTo run a testing server locally:\r\n\r\n1. Install docker.\r\n\r\n2. Run `tools/sync_test_server/start_server.sh`:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ncd tools/sync_test_server\r\n./start_server.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Run instrumentation tests:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ncd realm\r\n./gradlew connectedObjectServerDebugAndroidTest\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nSee [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details!\r\n\r\nThis project adheres to the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://realm.io/conduct).\r\nBy participating, you are expected to uphold this code.
